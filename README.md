# Userscripts
A collection of userscripts I've made:

* **Givee Club**: Removes the giveaways or ads that aren't related to the page in the "All active giveaways" section. Install it from [here](https://github.com/beltranamenabar/userscripts/raw/main/givee.club.user.js)
* **AllKeyShop**: Skips the wheel animation both on AKS and CDD and simulates that you have installed the extension on AKS so you can use the wheel twice a day. Install it from [here](https://github.com/beltranamenabar/userscripts/raw/main/allkeyshop.user.js)
